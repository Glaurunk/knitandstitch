<h3>Knit and Stitch</h3>

<p>Cheers to all!</p>
<p>This is my first "big Laravel Project". It is the first project where I separated the backend from the front end and fixed some sort of workflow that suits me best. I've also created middleware and user roles, so people can register and comment on the various articles and exhibits. I've dived deep into eloquent relationships and models and created a dynamic carousel and comments for two different models: for exhibits (aka: kknits) and posts (aka: stitches).
<p>The blog is in its final stages but not quite finished yet. However only some texts and finishing touches remain, so you get a pretty close idea of the final outcome.</p>
<p>feel free to comment and point out any bad practices or mistakes; I'll be happy to learn something new!</p>
